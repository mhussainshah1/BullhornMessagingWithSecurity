### Week Seven Challenge - Bullhorn Messaging App with Security

**You must use the classroom computers. If you do not use the classroom computers then you may not use "computer issues" as a reason for not fully completing the application. Time spent setting up your computer is time not spent programming.  You will be graded for how the website works for the user, not by how close your code is to making it work. So, your program either works or it doesn't.**

You are to write an application that is kind of like Twitter. It will allow a user to post a message, and everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted. 

### Features/Functionalities:

* The home page shall display a list of all messages
* Users shall sign up using a registration page
* Users shall be logged in to create a post or edit a post
* Users shall be permitted to edit only their own posts
* Every page (or template) should have a link (or button) to add a new message. This link shall be visible only when the user is logged in
* There shall be a link to Logout which, when clicked, logs out the user and redirects them to the login page. This link shall only be visible when the user is logged in.
* Implement Bootstrap to make the site look good
* Use a MySQL database to store your messages 
* Pre-loading data is recommended but not required. You probably want to modify the data loader to execute only once.
* Display the logged in username on every page (or in the navigation menu) where they are logged in.

If you don't know how to make a particular feature work then skip it and get the rest of the application working and uploaded in GitHub. Then go back and add the missing feature(s) - one at a time.

Test your application often and put it in GitHub often so you always have a working version on which to add the next feature.

Deploy your application to Heroku.
